Cancers (2022) The aim of the study was the appraisal of the diagnostic value of 14 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the early stages of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We established two classifiers. The first recognized cancerous from noncancerous tissues, the second successfully discriminated NSCLC subtypes (LUAD vs. LUSC). Our results indicate that the panel of 14 lncRNAs can be a promising tool to support a routine histopathological diagnosis of NSCLC. dalex: Responsible Machine Learning with Interactive Explainability and Fairness in Python Hubert Baniecki, Wojciech Kretowicz, Piotr Piątyszek, Jakub Wiśniewski, Przemyslaw Biecek Journal of Machine Learning Research (2021) We introduce dalex, a Python package which implements a model-agnostic interface for interactive explainability and fairness.

Checklist for responsible deep learning modeling of medical images based on COVID-19 detection studies Weronika Hryniewska, Przemysław Bombiński, Patryk Szatkowski, Paulina Tomaszewska, Artur Przelaskowski, Przemysław Biecek Pattern Recognition (2021) Our analysis revealed numerous mistakes made at different stages of data acquisition, model development, and explanation construction. In this work, we overview the approaches proposed in the surveyed Machine Learning articles and indicate typical errors emerging from the lack of deep understanding of the radiography domain. The final result is a proposed checklist with the minimum conditions to be met by a reliable COVID-19 diagnostic model. Towards explainable meta-learning Katarzyna Woźnica, Przemyslaw Biecek XKDD Workshop ECML (2021) To build a new generation of meta-models we need a deeper understanding of the importance and effect of meta-features on the model tunability. In this paper, we propose techniques developed for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to examine and extract knowledge from black-box surrogate models. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that shows how post-hoc explainability can be used to improve the meta-learning. Prevention is better than cure: a case study of the abnormalities detection in the chest Weronika Hryniewska, Piotr Czarnecki, Jakub Wiśniewski, Przemysław Bombiński, Przemysław Biecek “Beyond Fairness: Towards a Just, Equitable, and Accountable Computer Vision” CVPR Workshop (2021) In this paper, we analyze in detail a single use case - a Kaggle competition related to the detection of abnormalities in X-ray lung images. We demonstrate how a series of simple tests for data imbalance exposes faults in the data acquisition and annotation process. Complex models are able to learn such artifacts and it is difficult to remove this bias during or after the training. Simpler is better: Lifting interpretability-performance trade-off via automated feature engineering Alicja Gosiewska, Anna Kozak, Przemysław Biecek Decision Support Systems (2021) We propose a framework that uses elastic black boxes as supervisor models to create simpler, less opaque, yet still accurate and interpretable glass box models. The new models were created using newly engineered features extracted with the help of a supervisor model. We supply the analysis using a large-scale benchmark on several tabular data sets from the OpenML database.

Responsible Prediction Making of COVID-19 Mortality (Student Abstract) Hubert Baniecki, Przemyslaw Biecek AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021) During the literature review of COVID-19 related prognosis and diagnosis, we found out that most of the predictive models are not faithful to the RAI principles, which can lead to biassed results and wrong reasoning. To solve this problem, we show how novel XAI techniques boost transparency, reproducibility and quality of models. fairmodels: A Flexible Tool For Bias Detection, Visualization, And Mitigation Jakub Wiśniewski, Przemyslaw Biecek arXiv preprint (2021) This article introduces an R package fairmodels that helps to validate fairness and eliminate bias in classification models in an easy and flexible fashion. The fairmodels package offers a model-agnostic approach to bias detection, visualization and mitigation. The implemented set of functions and fairness metrics enables model fairness validation from different perspectives. The package includes a series of methods for bias mitigation that aim to diminish the discrimination in the model. Models in the Wild: On Corruption Robustness of Neural NLP Systems Barbara Rychalska, Dominika Basaj, Alicja Gosiewska, Przemyslaw Biecek International Conference on Neural Information Processing (2019) Natural Language Processing models lack a unified approach to robustness testing. In this paper we introduce WildNLP - a framework for testing model stability in a natural setting where text corruptions such as keyboard errors or misspelling occur. We compare robustness of deep learning models from 4 popular NLP tasks: Q&amp;A, NLI, NER and Sentiment Analysis by testing their performance on aspects introduced in the framework. In particular, we focus on a comparison between recent state-of-the-art text representations and non-contextualized word embeddings. In order to improve robustness, we perform adversarial training on selected aspects and check its transferability to the improvement of models with various corruption types. We find that the high performance of models does not ensure sufficient robustness, although modern embedding techniques help to improve it. We release the code of WildNLP framework for the community. auditor: an R Package for Model-Agnostic Visual Validation and Diagnostics Alicja Gosiewska, Przemyslaw Biecek The R Journal (2019) Machine learning models have successfully been applied to challenges in applied in biology, medicine, finance, physics, and other fields. With modern software it is easy to train even a complex model that fits the training data and results in high accuracy on test set. However, problems often arise when models are confronted with the real-world data. This paper describes methodology and tools for model-agnostic auditing. It provides functinos for assessing and comparing the goodness of fit and performance of models. In addition, the package may be used for analysis of the similarity of residuals and for identification of outliers and influential observations. The examination is carried out by diagnostic scores and visual verification. The code presented in this paper are implemented in the auditor package. Its flexible and consistent grammar facilitates the validation models of a large class of models. Explanations of Model Predictions with live and breakDown Packages Mateusz Staniak, Przemyslaw Biecek The R Journal (2018) Complex models are commonly used in predictive modeling. In this paper we present R packages that can be used for explaining predictions from complex black box models and attributing parts of these predictions to input features. We introduce two new approaches and corresponding packages for such attribution, namely live and breakDown. We also compare their results with existing implementations of state-of-the-art solutions, namely, lime (Pedersen and Benesty, 2018) which implements Locally Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations and iml (Molnar et al., 2018) which implements Shapley values. DALEX: Explainers for Complex Predictive Models in R Przemyslaw Biecek Journal of Machine Learning Research (2018) Predictive modeling is invaded by elastic, yet complex methods such as neural networks or ensembles (model stacking, boosting or bagging). Such methods are usually described by a large number of parameters or hyper parameters - a price that one needs to pay for elasticity. The very number of parameters makes models hard to understand. This paper describes a consistent collection of explainers for predictive models, a.k.a. black boxes. Each explainer is a technique for exploration of a black box model. Presented approaches are model-agnostic, what means that they extract useful information from any predictive method irrespective of its internal structure. Each explainer is linked with a specific aspect of a model. Some are useful in decomposing predictions, some serve better in understanding performance, while others are useful in understanding importance and conditional responses of a particular variable. Every explainer presented here works for a single model or for a collection of models. In the latter case, models can be compared against each other. Such comparison helps to find strengths and weaknesses of different models and gives additional tools for model validation. Presented explainers are implemented in the DALEX package for R. They are based on a uniform standardized grammar of model exploration which may be easily extended. archivist: An R Package for Managing, Recording and Restoring Data Analysis Results Przemyslaw Biecek, Marcin Kosiński Journal of Statistical Software (2017) Everything that exists in R is an object (Chambers 2016).

We intend to achieve this goal by building an information system based on artificial intelligence (AI) that will support the radiologist’s work by enriching the images with additional information. The unique feature of the proposed system is a trustworthy artificial intelligence module that: will reduce the image analysis time needed to detect lesions, will make the image evaluation process more transparent, will provide image and textual explanations indicating the rationale behind the proposed recommendation, will be verified for effective collaboration with the radiologist.

HOMER 2020-2025 HOMER: Human Oriented autoMated machinE leaRning images/project-homer One of the biggest challenges in the state-of-the-art machine learning is dealing with the complexity of predictive models. Recent techniques like deep neural networks, gradient boosting or random forests create models with thousands or even millions of parameters. This makes decisions generated by these black-box models completely opaque. Model obscurity undermines trust in model decisions, hampers model debugging, blocks model auditability, exposes models to problems with concept drift or data drift. Recently, there has been a huge progress in the area of model interpretability, which results in the first generation of model explainers, methods for better understanding of factors that drive model decisions. Despite this progress, we are still far from methods that provide deep explanations, confronted with domain knowledge that satisfies our ,,Right to explanation’’ as listed in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this project I am going to significantly advance next generation of explainers for predictive models. This will be a disruptive change in the way how machine learning models are created, deployed, and maintained. Currently to much time is spend on handcrafted models produced in a tedious and laborious try-and-error process. The proposed Human-Oriented Machine Learning will focus on the true bottleneck in development of new algorithms, i.e. on model-human interfaces. The particular directions I consider are (1) developing an uniform grammar for visual model exploration, (2) establishing a methodology for contrastive explanations that describe similarities and differences among different models, (3) advancing a methodology for non-additive model explanations, (4) creating new human-model interfaces for effective communication between models and humans, (5) introducing new techniques for training of interpretable models based on elastic surrogate black-box models, (6) rising new methods for automated auditing of fairness, biases and performance of predictive models.

DeCoviD 2021-2022 DeCoviD: Detection of Covid-19 related markers of pulmonary changes using Deep Neural Networks models supported by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Compressed Sensing images/project-decovid Covid-19 is an infectious respiratory disease. A coronavirus infection leaves permanent ramifications in the respiratory system and beyond. In this situation, tools supporting diagnosis and assessment of lung damage after infection and during Covid-19 treatment are crucial. Preliminary results of analysis of CT images and lung xrays suggest that they can help to quickly assess even asymptomatic cases and facilitate prognosis of response to treatment. There are also reports of usefulness of ultrasound images. The aim of the DeCoviD project is to develop methods and tools to support radiologists in the assessment of lung imaging data for the occurrence of changes caused by Covid-19 disease. The developed solution will allow to automate the identification of pathological changes and will support the diagnosis of coexisting lung diseases as well as diseases of other organs visible on chest images. It will also allow to quantify the severity of lung damage caused by the disease Responsible decision support for radiologists requires models based on interpretable features. Such features will be stored in a hybrid knowledge base powered by two research teams from WUT, working on the basis of two, seemingly opposite, paradigms of image data analysis. The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) team will use trained deep networks to automatically extract features that are essential for effective disease detection. Cognitive Compressed Sensing (CCS) will build a set of interpretable semantic features using sparse cognitive representations agreed with a group of cooperating radiologists. Combining these two approaches will achieve high effectiveness of the constructed models, combined with high transparency, clarity and stability of the solution. The DeCoviD project is a part of a broader strategy of competence development in the area of deep learning + XAI + medical applications at the Warsaw University of Technology.

DALEX 2018-2022 DALEX: Descriptive and model Agnostic Local EXplanations images/project-dalex Research project objectives. Black boxes are complex machine learning models, for example deep neural network, an ensemble of trees of high-dimensional regression model. They are commonly used due to they high performance. But how to understand the structure of a black-box, a model in which decision rules are too cryptic for humans? The aim of the project is to create a methodology for such exploration. To address this issue we will develop methods, that: (1) identify key variables that mostly determine a model response, (2) explain a single model response in a compact visual way through local approximations, (3) enrich model diagnostic plots. Research project methodology. This project is divided into three subprojects - local approximations od complex models (called LIVE), explanations of particular model predictions (called EXPLAIN) and conditional explanations (called CONDA). Expected impact on the development of science. Explanations of black boxes have fundamental implications for the field of predictive and statistical modelling. The advent of big data forces imposes usage of black boxes that are easily able to overperform classical methods. But the high performance itself does not imply that the model is appropriate. Thus, especially in applications to personalized medicine or some regulated fields, one should scrutinize decision rules incorporated in the model. New methods and tools for exploration of black-box models are useful for quick identification of problems with the model structure and increase the interpretability of a black-box Work on this project is financially supported by the NCN Opus grant 2017/27/B/ST6/0130. MLGenSig 2017-2021 MLGenSig: Machine Learning Methods for building of Integrated Genetic Signatures images/project-mlgensig Research project objectives. The main scientific goal of this project is to develop a methodology for integrated genetic signatures based on data from divergent high-throughput techniques used in molecular biology. Integrated signatures base on ensembles of signatures for RNA-seq, DNA-seq, data as well for methylation profiles and protein expression microarrays. The advent of high throughput methods allows to measure dozens of thousands or even millions features on different levels like DNA / RNA / protein. And nowadays in many large scale studies scientists use data from mRNA seq to assess the state of transcriptome, protein microarrays to asses the state of proteome and DNA-seq / bisulfide methylation to assess genome / methylome. Research methodology. Genetic signatures are widely used in different applications, among others: for assessing genes that differentiate cells that are chemo resistant vs. cells that are not, assess the stage of cell pluripotency, define molecular cancer subtypes. For example, in database Molecular Signatures Database v5.0 one can find thousands of gene sets - genetic signatures for various conditions. There are signatures that characterize some cancer cells, pluripotent cells and other groups. But they usually contain relatively small number of genes (around 100), results with them are hard to replicate and they are collection of features that were found significant when independently tested. In most cases signatures are derived from measurements of the same type. Like signatures based of expression of transcripts based on data from microarrays or RNA-seq, or methylation profile or DNA variation. We are proposing a very different approach. First we are going to use machine-learning techniques to create large collections of signatures. Such signatures base on ensembles of small sub-signatures, are more robust and usually have higher precision. Then out of such signatures we are going to develop methodology for meta-signatures, that integrate information from different types of data (transcriptome, proteome, genome). Great examples of such studies are: Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium (PCBC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies. For thousands of patients in different cohorts (for PCBC cohorts based on stemness phenotype, for TCGA based on cancer type) measurements of both mRNA, miRNA, DNA and methylation profiles are available. New, large datasets require new methods that take into account high and dense structure of dependencies between features. The task that we are going to solve is to develop methodology that will create genetic signatures that integrate information from different levels of cell functioning. Then we are going to use data from TCGA and PBCB project to assess the quality of proposed methodology. As a baseline we are going to use following methodologies: DESeq, edgeR (for mRNA), casper (for lternative splicing), MethylKit (for RRBS data) and RPPanalyzer for protein arrays. Here is the skeleton for our approach: (1) Use ensembles in order to building a genetic signature. The first step would be to use random forests to train a new signature. Ensembles of sub-signtures are build on bootstrap subsamples and they votes if given sample fit given signature or not. (2) In order to improve signatures we are going to consider various normalization of raw counts. We start with log and rank transformation. (3) In order to improve the process of training an ensemble we are going to use pre-filtering of genes. (4) Another approach is to use Bayesian based methods, that may incorporate the expert knowledge, like belief-based gaussian modelling Research project impact. Genetic profiling is more and more important and has number of application starting from basic classification up to personalized medicine in which patients are profiled against different signatures. Existing tools for genetic signatures have many citations. This we assume that the methodology for integrated genetic profiling will be a very useful for many research groups. It is hard to overestimate the impact of better genetic profiling on medicine. Moreover we build a team of people with knowledge in cancer genetic profiling Work on this project is financially supported by the NCN Opus grant 2016/21/B/ST6/02176.

Small groups encourage questions and the interactions within the group. Dates of upcoming trainings in 2022: 21-22 January, 18-19 February, 18-19 March, 22-23 April, 20-21 May. Agenda Day 1: We will start with a brief introduction to predictive modelling, then discuss tree based methods and ensembles like random forest and gradient boosting. We will end the day by discussing the hyperparameter tuning procedure. Day 2: We will start the second day with an introduction to explainable artificial intelligence. We discuss variable importance followed by Partial Dependence profiles, Shapley values, the LIME method and Ceteris Paribus profiles. Each block includes a presentation on the method, a hands-on session and Q&amp;A. Prerequisites We assume that participants have a basic knowledge of the language in which the training is conducted (R or Python). They can load data, perform simple EDA and build any predictive model, e.g. regression model. Language Depending on the group’s preference, the hands-on part can be carried out in R (mlr3 + DALEX) or Python (scikit-learn + dalex). The methodology part does not depend on the language. Price Price of the two-day online training: 899 EUR / 999 USD. Discounts available for groups of more than one person. If you are interested in private training for a group from your company please contact with us. Each participant will receive a paper materials in a form of a comic book https://betaandbit.github.io/RML/. Book your training To book a training please contact with trainings(at)solutions42.ai.

Przemysław Biecek Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN 2013-2018 Eseje o sztuce wizualizacji danych EN: Discover! Reveal! Explain! These three roles can be fulfilled by good statistical graphics. Good means understandable, faithful to the data, aesthetic. How to create such graphics? A collection of essays on the art of displaying data systematises knowledge useful in designing and producing good data visualisations. It is not easy. On the one hand, we can fall into the trap of a colourful mush full of numbers, which is sometimes proudly called infographics. On the other hand, we can fall into the trap of graphics that perfectly reproduce the complexity of numbers, and thus completely incomprehensible. Somewhere in the middle is a graphic that explains, that informs, that is aesthetically pleasing and informative. PL: Odkrywać! Ujawniać! Objaśniać! Te trzy role może spełniać dobra grafika statystyczna. Dobra czyli zrozumiała, wierna danym, estetyczna. Jak tworzyć taką grafikę? Zbiór esejów o sztuce pokazywania danych systematyzuje wiedzę przydatną do projektowania i wykonania dobrej wizualizacji danych. Nie jest to proste. Z jednej strony możemy wpaść w pułapkę pstrokatej papki najeżonej liczbami, którą czasem dumnie nazywa się infografiką. Z drugiej strony wpaść można w pułapkę grafiki idealnie odwzorowującej złożoność liczb a przez to zupełnie niezrozumiałej. Gdzieś po środku jest grafika, która wyjaśnia, która informuje, która jest estetyczna i informatywna. Książka online, Książka w księgarnii.
