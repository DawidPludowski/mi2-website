<p>Szymon Płotka, Maciej Chrabaszcz, Przemyslaw Biecek</p>
<p><strong>MICCAI (2024)</strong></p>
We introduce Swin Soft Mixture Transformer (Swin SMT), a novel architecture based on Swin UNETR, which incorporates a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (Soft MoE) to effectively handle complex and diverse long-range dependencies. The use of Soft MoE allows for scaling up model parameters maintaining a balance between computational complexity and segmentation performance in both training and inference modes. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that Swin SMT outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in 3D anatomical structure segmentation.

Molecular assays are not accessible to all uveal melanoma patients. We investigate machine learning models on clinicopathologic variables for risk stratification. Machine learning models included random survival forest and survival gradient boosting. They performed similarly or better than gene expression prognostic signature. Readily accessible clinicopathologic variables can provide adequate prognostic information.

This paper investigates the performance of various interpretation methods on a Vision Transformer (ViT) applied to classify chest X-ray images. We introduce the notion of evaluating faithfulness, sensitivity, and complexity of ViT explanations. The obtained results indicate that Layerwise relevance propagation for transformers outperforms Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations and Attention visualization, providing a more accurate and reliable representation of what a ViT has actually learned.

<p><strong>British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023)</strong></p>
Accurate risk stratification of uveal melanoma (UM) patients is important for determining the interval and frequency of surveillance. Loss of BAP1 expression has been shown to be strongly associated with UM-related death and metastasis.
In this study of 164 enucleated UMs, we assessed the prognostic role of preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) expression and Ki67 proliferation index measured by digital quantitation using QuPath programme in patients with BAP1-positive and BAP1-loss UMs.

<p><strong>Cancers (2023)</strong></p>
Although the biological function of lncRNAs has not been fully elucidated, we know that the aberrant expression of lncRNAs can drive the cancer phenotype. Therefore, a growing area of research is focusing on lncRNAs as putative diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The aim of the study was the appraisal of the diagnostic value of 14 differentially expressed lncRNA in the early stages of NSCLC. We established two classifiers. The first recognized cancerous from noncancerous tissues, the second successfully discriminated NSCLC subtypes (LUAD vs. LUSC). Our results indicate that the panel of 14 lncRNAs can be a promising tool to support a routine histopathological diagnosis of NSCLC.

<p><strong>Cancers (2023)</strong></p>
Similar to primary cutaneous Merkel cell carcinomas, virus-negative unknown primary tumors exhibited UV signatures and frequent high tumor mutational burdens, whereas few molecular alterations were noted in virus-positive tumors. Although additional studies are warranted for the virus-positive cases, our findings are supportive of a cutaneous metastatic origin for virus-negative Merkel cell carcinomas of unknown primary.

miRNA research in glaucoma has provided significant insights into the molecular mechanisms of the disease, offering potential biomarkers, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic targets. However, addressing challenges such as variability and limited tissue accessibility is essential, and further investigations and validation will contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional significance of miRNAs in glaucoma.

<p><strong>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (2023)</strong></p>
To what extent can the patient's length of stay in a hospital be predicted using only an X-ray image? We answer this question by comparing the performance of machine learning survival models on a novel multi-modal dataset created from 1235 images with textual radiology reports annotated by humans. We introduce time-dependent model explanations into the human-AI decision making process. For reproducibility, we open-source code and the TLOS dataset at <a href="https://github.com/mi2datalab/xlungs-trustworthy-los-prediction">this URL</a>.

<p><strong>Cancers (2022)</strong></p>
Patients with amelanotic uveal melanomas (those without pigment) lived longer and the eventual spread of the neoplastic process occurred later than in patients with heavily pigmented tumours. In heavily pigmented uveal melanomas, we found features on histopathological examination that were associated with an unfavourable prognosis. In the two separate groups of uveal melanomas with different degrees of pigmentation, we observed that amelanotic tumours with a lower clinical stage had the best prognosis.

In this paper, we analyze in detail a single use case - a Kaggle competition related to the detection of abnormalities in X-ray lung images. We demonstrate how a series of simple tests for data imbalance exposes faults in the data acquisition and annotation process. Complex models are able to learn such artifacts and it is difficult to remove this bias during or after the training.

Utilizing the TCGA PANCAN12 dataset we discovered that cancer patients with mutations in TP53 tumor suppressor and overexpression of MDM2 oncogene exhibited decreased survival post treatment.  Our findings demonstrate that molecular chaperones aid cancer cells in surviving the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutics and may have therapeutic implications.
