Remote sensing applications require machine learning models that are reliable and robust, highlighting the importance of red teaming for uncovering flaws and biases. We introduce a novel red teaming approach for hyperspectral image analysis, specifically for soil parameter estimation in the Hyperview challenge. Utilizing SHAP for red teaming, we enhanced the top-performing model based on our findings. Additionally, we introduced a new visualization technique to improve model understanding in the hyperspectral domain.
