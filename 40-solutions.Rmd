**Research as a service**

Our team has experience not only in groundbreaking research, but also in deploying these research into business.

There are many ways we can help, for example

- help in delivery of champion-challenger evaluations in which we look for potential to increase the effectiveness of predictive models in your company.
- take care of the whole life cycle of the predictive models, from reproducibility of results to constant monitoring and continuous improvement of the model.
- audit models and analyse the sensitivity and vulnerability of the model to incorrect or unexpected behaviours.

We would be happy to discuss how we could help with your organisation!
