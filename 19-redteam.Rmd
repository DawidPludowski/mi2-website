<p><strong>CVPR Workshops (2024)</strong></p>
The Segment Anything Model is one of the first and most well-known foundation models for computer vision segmentation tasks. This work presents a multi-faceted red-teaming analysis of SAM. We analyze the impact of style transfer on segmentation masks. We assess whether the model can be used for attacks on privacy, such as recognizing celebrities' faces. Finally, we check how robust the model is to adversarial attacks on segmentation masks under text prompts.

<p><strong>ICLR Workshops (2024)</strong></p>
Remote sensing applications require machine learning models that are reliable and robust, highlighting the importance of red teaming for uncovering flaws and biases. We introduce a novel red teaming approach for hyperspectral image analysis, specifically for soil parameter estimation in the Hyperview challenge. Utilizing SHAP for red teaming, we enhanced the top-performing model based on our findings. Additionally, we introduced a new visualization technique to improve model understanding in the hyperspectral domain.

<p><strong>Information Fusion (2024)</strong></p>
Explanations of machine learning models can be manipulated. We introduce a unified notation and taxonomy of adversarial attacks on explanations. Adversarial examples, data poisoning, and backdoor attacks are key safety issues in XAI. Defense methods like model regularization improve the robustness of explanations. We outline the emerging research directions in adversarial XAI.

<p><strong>Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (2023)</strong></p>
This paper proposes how different Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA) methods complement each other and discusses why it is essential to juxtapose them. The introduced process of Interactive EMA (IEMA) derives from the algorithmic side of explainable machine learning and aims to embrace ideas developed in cognitive sciences. We formalize the grammar of IEMA to describe human-model interaction. We conduct a user study to evaluate the usefulness of IEMA, which indicates that an interactive sequential analysis of a model may increase the accuracy and confidence of human decision making.

We showcase that PD can be manipulated in an adversarial manner, which is alarming, especially in financial or medical applications where auditability became a must-have trait supporting black-box machine learning. The fooling is performed via poisoning the data to bend and shift explanations in the desired direction using genetic and gradient algorithms.

<p>Barbara Rychalska, Dominika Basaj, Alicja Gosiewska, Przemyslaw Biecek</p>
<p><strong>International Conference on Neural Information Processing (2019)</strong></p>
In this paper we introduce WildNLP - a framework for testing model stability in a natural setting where text corruptions such as keyboard errors or misspelling occur. We compare robustness of deep learning models from 4 popular NLP tasks: Q&A, NLI, NER and Sentiment Analysis by testing their performance on aspects introduced in the framework. In particular, we focus on a comparison between recent state-of-the-art text representations and non-contextualized word embeddings. In order to improve robustness, we perform adversarial training on selected aspects and check its transferability to the improvement of models with various corruption types. We find that the high performance of models does not ensure sufficient robustness, although modern embedding techniques help to improve it.
